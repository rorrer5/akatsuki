Hello World!

rorrer here, I'm beginning to get into software development and my first step is web development.

Currently working on HTML and CSS with my next steps being Javascript and React. Eventually I would like to branch out much further and expand my knowledge when it comes to coding and programming.

I'm fairly new to all of this, but I am hoping with time and dedication that I can launch myself into a career I've always had interest in.

I've read that this website (GitHub) is a must-have when it comes to programming, and after learning what it's about, I can see why. Networking and collaboration are key when coming up with and refining ideas.

This is just the beginning, but I'm excited for where it will lead me!
